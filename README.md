# An Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are two incredibly powerful tools for anyone who writes code.  They can, however, be rather difficult to get started using.

In this repo, I put together a basic outline of the steps I go through to create a Git repository and then share it on GitHub.  Hopefully, this basic template will help new users get started with Git and GitHub.

To see the template, [go here](http://kferris10.github.io/git-github-intro/).  If you have questions or wish to add to it, create a new issue or a pull request.
