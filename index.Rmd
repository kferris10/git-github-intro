# Introduction

What we'll cover today:

1. [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source version control system.  It makes development more friendly by keeping track of all your changes for you.
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web based hosting service.  It allows use to put your projects online so that other people can learn about them and contribute.

# Why Should I Care

- Almost everything is on GitHub
- Git and GitHub combine to make development and collaboration easy
- It's an excellent way to show off your code/projects/analyses with others
- It's really easy to create web pages, documentation, or even your own web site!
- They're free!

# The Basic Git Workflow

## When you start a new project

1. Use `cd` to navigate to the directory
2. Use `git init` to initialize a new git repository
3. Use `git status` to see what's going on
4. Use `git add --all` to tell git to track all files
5. Use `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to store your files

## After you've made some edits

1. Use `git status` to see what's changed
2. Use `git add list-of-files` to prepare the changes
3. Use `git commit -m "commit message"` to record your files
4. Use `git status` to check the current status

## Creating a GitHub repository

1. Login to GitHub and create a new repository
2. Use `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git` to create a pointer named *origin*.  This tells git where the GitHub repository is located.
3. Use `git push -u origin master` to send your repository to GitHub
